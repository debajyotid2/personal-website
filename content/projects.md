### [Sea Turtle Conservation Using Feature Matching Algorithms](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/blog/tracking-turtles-how-ai-helps-conservationists-to-re-identify-sea-turtles)

Jan 2024 – Apr 2024

{{< collapse summary="🔍 Detailed Overview" >}}

Collaborating with [Sea Turtle Conservation Bonaire (STCB)](https://www.bonaireturtles.org/wp/), we developed an AI-driven application to identify individual sea turtles from photographs, enhancing conservation efforts by understanding their migratory patterns. I was a member of the feature extraction and matching team in the "AI for Turtles" project, where our primary goal was to develop a system capable of accurately identifying individual sea turtles from photographs. After evaluating various methods including [SIFT](https://home.cis.rit.edu/~cnspci/references/dip/feature_extraction/lowe1999.pdf) and [LoFTR](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Sun_LoFTR_Detector-Free_Local_Feature_Matching_With_Transformers_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf), we selected [LightGlue](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Lindenberger_LightGlue_Local_Feature_Matching_at_Light_Speed_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf) for feature extraction due to its superior performance, achieving a 92% matching accuracy and 86% accuracy in detecting novel individuals. LightGlue utilizes the SIFT algorithm to identify key points in images, which are then matched to determine the top five similar turtles in the database. We introduced the use of the Wasserstein score to assess the distribution of confidence scores for keypoint pairs, aiding in the identification process. This approach significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of re-identifying sea turtles, providing conservationists with a powerful tool to monitor and protect these endangered species.

### [Toxic Industrial Smoke Detection from Camera Feed](https://www.frissewind.nu/articles/ai)

Jul 2023 – Feb 2024

{{< collapse summary="🔍 Detailed Overview" >}}

As developers on the AI monitoring project of [Fruitpunch AI](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/) for emissions from a steel plant, we collaborated with [FrisseWind.nu](https://www.frissewind.nu/) and [Greenpeace Netherlands](https://www.greenpeace.org/nl/) to create an AI system that automatically detects harmful emissions from the steel plant. We integrated this system with existing webcams and the [SpotdeGifwolk.nl](https://spotdegifwolk.nl/) platform, enabling real-time monitoring of the factories. Our deep learning model successfully identified multiple prohibited emissions which were reported to the authorities for enforcement. This innovation significantly increased the efficiency of monitoring efforts, allowing for more comprehensive oversight of environmental impact of the steel plant.

### [Multivariate Linear Regression Using Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://github.com/debajyotid2/gradient_descent)

Jul 2023 – Aug 2023

{{< collapse summary="🔍 Detailed Overview" >}}

I created this project as a demonstration of multivariate linear regression using stochastic gradient descent, implemented in both C and Python. The C version leverages the OpenBLAS library for efficient matrix and vector operations, while the Python version utilizes NumPy for similar functionalities. Both implementations include scripts for building and running the code, as well as unit tests to ensure correctness. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding and applying gradient descent algorithms in linear regression models.

**Key technologies**: NumPy, BLAS, Optimization, Linear Algebra, HPC, Machine Learning.

### [Uncertainty Analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease Cell-Free mRNA Assay Classifier](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D562DAQEahK4YdCa1gw/profile-treasury-document-pdf-analyzed/profile-treasury-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1732575334006?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=qaGLTUFGYh6Jrsnb9XKJVuxTJYuk4j7PZ16xqvc19U0)

Jan 2023 – May 2023

{{< collapse summary="🔍 Detailed Overview" >}}

I led the student team as part of [The Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu/) in this project. We focused on modeling the measurement uncertainty of a high-dimensional RNA-Seq classifier for Alzheimer’s Disease using Monte Carlo simulations per FDA guidance. The classifier, built with penalized logistic regression on 965 genes, was analyzed to assess variations under different levels of relative standard deviation in transcript counts. We designed a modular and reproducible workflow to efficiently simulate and document assay variations, leveraging the [Anvil supercomputer](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/anvil) for large-scale computation. We found that differential classification primarily occurred near the binary classification threshold, with significant robustness to simulated variations due to the classifier’s high dimensionality. Our work highlights the importance of rigorous measurement uncertainty modeling in advancing precision medicine and improving diagnostic reproducibility.
