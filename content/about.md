My work focuses on developing machine learning algorithms, productionizing models, and scaling AI solutions to address real-world challenges. At Siemens, I built AI systems grounded in physics-based simulations and deployed them on edge infrastructure to enhance the scalability and efficiency of [battery gigafactories](https://www.siemens.com/us/en/industries/battery-manufacturing.html). Beyond my professional endeavors, I actively contribute to open-source initiatives and volunteer projects that align with my skills, like [designing data models for sustainable home heating systems](https://github.com/codeforboston/home-energy-analysis-tool) or [crafting deep learning algorithms to support wildlife conservation](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/blog/tracking-turtles-how-ai-helps-conservationists-to-re-identify-sea-turtles). Across these efforts, I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation.

My career trajectory began in chemical engineering at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) and evolved through roles in manufacturing, data science, and machine learning. Early experiences, including optimizing manufacturing operations and leading teams, honed my problem-solving mindset and curiosity for computational methods. Researching computational fluid dynamics at [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/chemeng/index.php) deepened my interest in numerical approaches, which I advanced during graduate studies at Purdue University, specializing in [data science and computational engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/academics/ogsps/cigp/index.html). Subsequently, as an intern at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/), I developed tools to model battery refurbishment scenarios, bridging research and practical applications in sustainable energy systems.

I continue to explore my curiosity in my professional and personal endeavors, programming or otherwise. As [Sir C.V. Raman](https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-V-Raman) said, _"True knowledge is gained not through rote learning, but through curiosity and the desire to explore."_
