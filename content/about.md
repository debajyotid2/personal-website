My day-to-day work involves developing machine learning algorithms, productionizing ML models, and scaling AI solutions for real-world challenges. In my current position at Siemens, my projects involve building AI solutions based on physics-based simulations and deploying them on edge infrastructure for making [battery gigafactories scalable and efficient](https://www.siemens.com/us/en/industries/battery-manufacturing.html). 

Outside of work, I’m passionate about contributing to open-source initiatives and volunteer projects that intersect with my skills and values. From [designing data models to help estimate home heating requirements](https://github.com/codeforboston/home-energy-analysis-tool) and assess heat pump capacity to [developing deep learning algorithms for wildlife conservation](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/blog/tracking-turtles-how-ai-helps-conservationists-to-re-identify-sea-turtles), I am driven by the opportunity to create meaningful impact. Through each step of my journey, I’ve sought not just to adapt to change, but to embrace it, turning new challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation.

My career journey has been a dynamic evolution, beginning in chemical engineering at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) and gradually transitioning into data science, computational science, and machine learning. Starting as a production engineer at a manufacturing facility, I learned the intricacies of optimizing manufacturing operations and team leadership. This experience laid the foundation for my problem-solving mindset and drove my curiosity toward data and computational techniques.

During my time researching [pulsatile Taylor flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatile_flow) in microchannels at [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/chemeng/index.php), I explored the fundamentals of computational fluid dynamics. This role deepened my understanding of numerical methods and gave me a glimpse of the power of custom programming solutions in research, cementing my interest in computational approaches and setting the stage for my graduate studies at Purdue University, where I specialized in [data science and computational engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/academics/ogsps/cigp/index.html). 

Later, as an intern at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/), I developed tools for sensitivity analysis and modeled battery refurbishment scenarios to estimate reductions in the demand for critical minerals in electric vehicle battery supply chains. These experiences helped me bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications.
