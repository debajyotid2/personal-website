      Hi, I am Deb, a software engineer with a focus on machine learning, AI model deployment, and simulation, most recently working at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/us/en/industries/battery-manufacturing/battery-smart-manufacturing.html). My previous experience includes developing tools for sensitivity analysis at [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) and researching heat transfer problems using computational fluid dynamics at [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/chemeng/index.php). Additionally I have gained significant experience applying deep learning algorithms to solve problems for [social good](https://www.fruitpunch.ai/blog/tracking-turtles-how-ai-helps-conservationists-to-re-identify-sea-turtles). With graduate studies focused on data and computational science at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/academics/ogsps/cigp/index.html), I am passionate about leveraging technology to create meaningful impact.
