Sea Turtle Conservation Using Feature Matching Algorithms
Jan 2024 ‚Äì Apr 2024

    üîç Detailed Overview
    Collaborating with Sea Turtle Conservation Bonaire (STCB), we developed an AI-driven application to identify individual sea turtles from photographs, enhancing conservation efforts by understanding their migratory patterns. As a member of the feature extraction and matching team in the &ldquo;AI for Turtles&rdquo; project, our primary goal was to develop a system capable of accurately identifying individual sea turtles from photographs. After evaluating various methods including SIFT and LoFTR, we selected LightGlue for feature extraction due to its superior performance, achieving a 92% matching accuracy and 86% accuracy in detecting novel individuals. LightGlue utilizes the SIFT algorithm to identify key points in images, which are then matched to determine the top five similar turtles in the database. We introduced the use of the Wasserstein score to assess the distribution of confidence scores for keypoint pairs, aiding in the identification process. This approach significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of re-identifying sea turtles, providing conservationists with a powerful tool to monitor and protect these endangered species.">

    <p>This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the activation energies of chemical reactions, leveraging advanced computational methods and chemical datasets composed of <a href="https://daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html">SMILES</a> strings. Created as part of my master‚Äôs capstone project under the guidance of <a href="https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/brett-savoie/">Prof. Brett Savoie</a>, the project integrates domain knowledge with data-driven techniques to address challenges in reaction kinetics. By analyzing key molecular features, the models aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of predicting activation energy, facilitating advancements in catalyst design and reaction optimization. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing data, training models, and evaluating predictions, providing a comprehensive toolkit for future research in this domain.</p>

    <summary>üîç Detailed Overview</summary>
    <p>The <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals</a> project is a collection of cryptography challenges aimed at exposing vulnerabilities in modern cryptographic algorithms, which I am solving using Rust. This endeavor has significantly deepened my understanding of cryptographic principles and enhanced my proficiency in Rust. Currently, I have completed Sets 1 through 6, covering topics from basic encoding to RSA and DSA, and I continue to work on the remaining sets. The project is organized with each set as its own crate, facilitating modular development and testing.</p>
<p><strong>Key technologies</strong>: Rust, Cryptography.</p>

    <summary>üîç Detailed Overview</summary>
    <p>The <code>matlibr</code> project is a barebones implementation of a 2D matrix datatype in C, designed to perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, with acceleration provided by <a href="https://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> libraries.  Developing this library has enhanced my understanding of matrix computations and the integration of BLAS for performance optimization in C. Currently, the project supports double precision and integer data types, matrix-scalar operations, matrix-vector operations, gather operations along rows or columns, and computation of L1 and L2 norms.  I continue to work on expanding its functionality and improving its efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Key technologies</strong>: BLAS, Linear Algebra, C.</p>

    <p>The <code>yatpool</code> project is a thread pool implementation in pure C, utilizing <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html">POSIX threads</a> to manage and execute multiple tasks concurrently.  Developing this project has enhanced my understanding of multithreading and synchronization mechanisms in C, particularly in creating efficient and reusable thread management systems. Currently, the project features a simple API for initializing the thread pool, submitting tasks, and managing their execution.  I continue to work on expanding its functionality and improving its efficiency.</p>
